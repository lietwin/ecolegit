**Current Behavior:**  
The existing architecture anticipates extensibility by incorporating `ecologits` with an adaptation layer. However, the current Readme and license identify ecolegit as an Ecologits wrapper service.

**Desired Behavior:**  
My goal is to offer the best AI impact estimation tool available based on the state of the art calculations and methods. Ecologits is currently a provider, but I plan to incorporate emerging and validated providers in the future. This could involve swapping for new providers or integrating multiple ones.

Use two parallel subagents to brainstorm potential plans. Do not implement any code.
